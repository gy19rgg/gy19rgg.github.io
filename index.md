#Hello World

This is my first go at writing in Markup.  *It will be rubbish.*

Here's a few reasons why I'm using Markup:
1. I've already tried HTML
1. Markup is accepted by journals
1. I might want to write a blog at some point
	1. Jekyl is an excellent, simple way of blogging
	1. There's no GUI, so you have to code everything as you want it
	1. Simple = beautiful

Here's a link to Jekyl I can use later: [Jekyl](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/)
